# rtsir_lab1
Module 1 and Module 2
Here Module1.cpp contains code of problems given in module1
Here Module2.cpp and main.py both contains code of problems given in module2
main.py is for searching algorithms. I have done it in python to calculate the time efficiently.
We will generate random num in code and write them in a file thats why there is sample.txt files.
Lab report is provided in lab1_71.pdf file
